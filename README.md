# COMP2051-UNNC-AIM-Coursework
## Introduction
This coursework requires to use Variable Neighborhood Search(VNS) algorithm to solve bin packing problem by using C++. In this coursework, 3 instances files are provided, respectively representing easy, medium and hard instances. From which 10 instances shall be selected for testing and evaluation of your algorithm in marking. For each test instance, only 1 run is conducted and its objective value is used for marking the performance component.

## Files
20217275.cpp is the VNS code and more details are in the other file 20217275_AIM_report.
